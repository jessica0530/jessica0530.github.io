## Spark RPC

Protocal 

Dispatcher

Threads

Metrics

## Netty

Thread Models

I/O Models

Pipeline

Frame Decoding

Zero Copy

## NIO

BIO

AIO

## Netty 

Unified API for various transport types

Flexible and extensible event model

Zero-Copy-Capable Rich Byte Buffer

Common Protocol Support

High Performance

   Throughput,Latency

   Less resource consumption

   Minimized unnecessary memory copy

## Why Netty

Why not use JDK NIO directly

### MORE

Frame Decoding

Idle Detection

### BETTER

Fix JDK NIO Bugs(more active and faster, provides workaround if not fixable)

More powerful and friendly API (ByteBuffer -> ByteBuf:auto resizing, memory pool)

Easily switching to another i/o model



Why Spark 2.0 replace Akka with Netty SPARK-5293

Avoid version conflicts between Spark and User Application

The usage of Akka in Spark is limited, which can be easily replaced
